# Liam's scuffed ass dotfiles
## for the love of God, please only use these dotfiles as an example. this is not cause I'm elitist about "oh you have to use your own dots" or some shit, it's because my dotfiles are likely absolute cursed fuckery that shouldn't be touched with a ten foot pole, and I don't want people using them and having their systems broken
## With that said, please feel free to use them as examples to configure your own system!

I started my window manager hopping using bspwm, and honestly still consider it my favorite window manager. But due to system compatibility issues, among other problems I've been looking more and more into switching to a Wayland based WM such as SWAY, until BSPWM has Wayland support (devs pls pls pls I'm begging you I'm on my knees) I'm very sad about the fact that I have to do what feels like starting from scratch after putting so much work into my current BSPWM setup, but I guess that's just how the cookie crumbles (I do not like it!!!!)
